// Create a CourseException class that extends Exception and whose
// constructor receives a String that holds a college courseâ€™s department
// (for example, CIS), a course number (for example, 101),and a number of credits (for example, 3).
// Save the file as CourseException.java.
// Create a Course class with the same fields and whose constructor requires values for each field. Upon construction,
// throw a CourseException if the department does not consist of three letters,
// if the course number does not consist of three digits between 100 and 499 inclusive,
// or if the credits are less than 0.5 or more than 6.
// Save the class as Course.java.
// Write an application that establishes an array of at least six Course objects with valid and invalid values.
// Display an appropriate message when a Course object is created successfully and when one is not.
// Save the file as ThrowCourseException.java.
