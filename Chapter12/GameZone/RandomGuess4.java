// In Chapter 1, you created a class called RandomGuess.
// In this game, the application generates a random number for a player to guess.
// In Chapter 5, you improved the application to display a message indicating whether
// the playerâ€™s guess was correct, too high, or too low.
//
// In Chapter 6, you further improved the game by adding a loop that
// continually prompts the user to enter the correct value,if necessary.
//
// As written, the game should work as long as the player enters numeric guesses.
// The game throws an exception, however, if the player enters a letter or other nonNumeric character.
// Discover the type of Exception thrown,
// then improve the game by handling the exception
// so that the user is informed about the error and allowed to attempt to enter the correct data again.
// Save the file as RandomGuess4.java.
