// Each week, the Pickering Trucking Company randomly selects one of its 30 employees to take a drug test.
// Write an application that determines which employee will be selected each week for the next 52 weeks.
// Use the Math.random() function explained in Appendix D to generate an employee number between 1 and 30; you use a statement similar to:
// testedEmployee = 1 + (int) (Math.random() * 30);
// After each selection, display the number of the employee to test. Display four employee numbers on each line.
// It is important to note that if testing is random, some employees will be tested multiple times, and others might never be tested.
// Run the application several times until you are confident that the selection is random. Save the file as DrugTests.java.
